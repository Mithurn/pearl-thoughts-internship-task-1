## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

- **Login** with any email (password field appears after entering an email).
- **Browse doctors** and view their full details.
- **Book an appointment** by selecting a time slot.
- **See a confirmation** on successful booking.
- All data is loaded from static JSON files—no backend required.

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

- Mobile-first UI, but looks great on desktop too!
- Uses Tailwind’s responsive classes for seamless experience on all devices.

---

## 📦 Customization

- To add or edit doctors, update `src/app/data/doctors.json`.
- To change available time slots, update `src/app/data/timeslots.json`.

---

## 🙌 Credits

- UI inspired by Figma design provided for the assignment.
- Built with ❤️ using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
